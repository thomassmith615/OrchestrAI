## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Milestone 1: foundation, command contract, and CLI shell.
  - TypeScript project with strict compiler settings, ESM output, and the
    `orch` binary.
  - Executable Definition of Done via `npm run verify` (typecheck, lint, test,
    build) and a matching GitHub Actions workflow.
  - Core primitives: error taxonomy with the full exit code contract, leveled
    logger with injectable sinks, environment snapshot with injectable host.
  - Engine layer: neutral `CommandDefinition` contract, `CommandResult` with
    both a machine readable payload and a human readable report, and a command
    registry that every surface consumes.
  - CLI layer: commander adaptation, aligned human rendering, universal
    `--json`, and global `--verbose`, `--quiet`, `--cwd` flags.
  - `orch info`.
  - Charter, CLI contract, architecture document, Version 1 roadmap, and ADRs
    0001 to 0004.

### Changed

- Version 1 roadmap consolidated from 25 milestones to 12. Verification gates
  resequenced ahead of context packing; project memory resequenced after the
  end to end orchestration loop. Total scope is unchanged.
- Binary renamed from `orchestrai` to `orch`. The npm package name is
  unchanged.
- Milestone 1 reimplemented around the engine command contract after the CLI
  first product decision. See ADR 0004.
